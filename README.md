# tabs-memento

This project is an extension for Chrome to help users that are not allowed to change Chrome initial page behaviour.<br/>
This usually happens in corporate enviroments where security policies disable the ability to modify some Chrome preferences, like to open the tabs of the last Chrome session.<br/>
<br/>
The project is open source, the icons are from <a href="http://www.iconarchive.com/show/outline-icons-by-designcontest/Camera-icon.html">IconArchive</a>, for commercial usage require backlink.
